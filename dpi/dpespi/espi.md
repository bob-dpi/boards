### ESPI: Enhanced SPI Interface Card

The Enhanced SPI Interface card (ESPI) lets you connect any SPI
integrated circuit to your robot or other automation. The card has a
prototyping area as well as pads for both TSSOP and SSOP surface mount
chips.

**Features:** <br>
 \- Easily connects to most SPI chips<br>
 \- Prototyping area as well as TSSOP and SSOP pads<br>
 \- 5 or 3.3 volt compatible<br>
 \- Uses the ESPI 7474 circuit for reliable operation<br>
 \- User space device driver (part of pcdaemon)<br>
<br>

The ESPI card must be paired with the "espi" peripheral and driver.  



**Hardware:** <br>

The schematic of the ESPI is shown below. The Eagle schematic and board
files are available here: [espi.sch](espi.sch) and here [espi.brd](espi.brd).
