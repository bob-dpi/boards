### EI2C: Enhanced I2C Interface Card

The Enhanced I2C Interface card (EI2C) lets you connect an I2C
integrated circuit to your system. The card has a prototyping area as
well as pads for both TSSOP and SSOP surface mount chips.

**Features:** <br>
<strong>-</strong> Easily connects to most I2C chips<br>
<strong>-</strong> Prototyping area as well as TSSOP and SSOP pads<br>
<strong>-</strong> 5 or 3.3 volt compatible<br>
<strong>-</strong> Uses the ESPI 7474 circuit for reliable operation<br>
<br>

The EI2C card must be paired with the "ei2c" peripheral and driver.  The
board includes an open-drain driver to accommodate the Spartan-3E which
does not support open-drain outputs.
 

**Hardware:** <br>
The schematic of the EI2C are shown below. The Eagle schematic and board
files are available here: [ei2c.sch](ei2c.sch) and here [ei2c.brd](ei2c.brd).
