### US8: Octal SRF04 Interface Card

The US8 card provides an interface to eight SRF04 ultrasonic distance
sensors. Sensors are pinged in parallel and can be enabled individually.
Time between pings can be from 10 to 150 milliseconds. Distance readings
have a resolution of about one-hundredth of an inch.
