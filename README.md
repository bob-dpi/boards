# Boards
Some peripherals use common, off-the-shelf hardware such as
Pmod cards.  Some peripherals use custom hardware.  This
repository contains design files for peripherals that use 
custom hardware.

The [***contrib***](contrib/README.md)  directory has design
files for boards that have been contributed.  Each design is 
in its own directory, has its own LICENSE.txt, and should 
have a markdown file to describe the board.  

The [***dpi***](dpi/README.md) directory has the design files
for Demand Peripherals boards that can tolerate ringing
on long cable runs.
