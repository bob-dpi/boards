### RLY410: Quad 10 Amp Relay Card

The RLY410 Quad Power Relay Card has four 8 Amp single-pole double-throw
relays which can be individually controlled.

**Features:** <br>
 \- Four individually controlled SPDT power relays<br>
 \- 8 amp current rating at 30 VDC<br>
 \- Rugged, fully sealed Class B relays<br>
 \- Discrete FET driver per relay<br>
 \- 5 volt coil voltage<br>
<br>

Most FPGAs can be configured with a weak pull-up to be applied during
bring-up and before the FPGA images can specify the desired pin values.
The RLY410 card is designed to *not* activate any of the relays with
just the pull-up voltage and current.  This prevents false closures
during system bring-up.

 

**Hardware:** <br>
The schematic of the RLY410 is shown below. The Eagle schematic and
board files are available here: [rly410.sch](rly410.sch) and
[rly410.brd](rly410.brd).
