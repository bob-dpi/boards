# contrib
This directory has the hardware design files for peripherals that
need custom hardware.  There are also design files for some simple
accessories and for one FPGA card.  Each design is in its own directory,
has its own LICENSE.txt, and should have a markdown file that describes
the board.  

While many design use Eagle, the preferred format is KiCad.
