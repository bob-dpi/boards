**Features:** <br>
 \- Four slide switches<br />
 \- LEDs to indicate switch position<br />
 \- Works with or without FPGA card<br />
<br>

The quad slide switch card can be either polled or event driven when
used with the "in4" FPGA peripheral and driver. This means your program
does not need to poll the switch looking for switch movement.

 

**Hardware:** <br>
The schematic of the quad slide switch card is shown below.
The Eagle schematic and board files are available here:
[sw4.sch](sw4.sch) and [sw4.brd](sw4.brd).
