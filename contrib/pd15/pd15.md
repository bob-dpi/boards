### PD15: 15 Amp Power Distribution Card

The PD15 power distribution card is a break-out card which makes it easy
to control, protect, and distribute power from a battery.

**Hardware:**

The PD15 can handle up to 15 amps and has a fuse to limit the maximum
current. The card uses an ATO blade style automotive so you can easily
set the maximum current you want.

The PD15 provides a low current on/off switch which in turn controls
three 20-amp AOD409 PMOS FETs. The FETs act as a kind of power relay for
the card and using PMOS FETs lets the card switch the "high side" of the
battery. Switching the high side of the battery lets you use battery
ground as system ground.

A two terminal input lets you control the device remotely. This is handy
for switches that have to be mounted away from the card and for timed
on/off using a real-time clock card.

Power output is on three mechanically secure and easy to use screw
terminals. Each screw terminal can handle at most 15 amps and the sum of
all the currents through the screw terminals should not exceed 15 amps
or the fuse value.

Battery charging is made easy by the inclusion of a 5.5 mm barrel
connector that is tied directly to the battery. Current into this
connector should not exceed 2 amps.

The schematic and layout of the PD15 are shown below. The Eagle
schematic and board files are available here:
